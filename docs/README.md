# DIP Testbed Platform
DIP Testbed Platform allows users to remotely program and experience physical, embedded devices through various virtual interfaces (uni-directional webcam stream, bi-directional serial connection stream).  

## ðŸŒ¸ ðŸŒ¼ DIP User Tutorial Guides ðŸŒ¼ ðŸŒ¸
_Hopefully if I have enough time I will create detailed tutorials for beginners_  
_Meanwhile you can check out the platform prototypes which are like "get your hands dirty" type of tutorials_  
  
## ðŸŒ¸ ðŸŒ¼ DIP Client ðŸŒ¼ ðŸŒ¸
DIP Client is the main CLI tool to interact with the DIP Testbed platform.  
For more documentations see [CLIENT.md](./CLIENT.md)  

Latest release: https://github.com/kshaa/dip-testbed-dist/releases/latest/download/dip_client_amd64  
Quick install: `curl https://github.com/kshaa/dip-testbed-dist/releases/latest/download/client_install.sh | bash`  

## ðŸŒ¸ ðŸŒ¼ DIP Platform Prototypes ðŸŒ¼ ðŸŒ¸
The author of this academic work created various prototypes when manually emulating end-user usage of the platform.  
The prototypes, their source codes and descriptions can be seen in [prototypes](../prototypes/README.md)  
  
## DIP Server usage  
DIP Server is a central service responsible for data management and connecting platform end-users, hardware devices & virtual interfaces

## Academic purpose server
There is an academic test server hosted in the cloud:  
- Static content server: [`http://testbed.veinbahs.lv/`](`http://testbed.veinbahs.lv/`)  
- Control server: [`ws://testbed.veinbahs.lv/`](`ws://testbed.veinbahs.lv/`)  

_Note: This server is a piece of academic work, no serious guarantees about data security are made, don't sensitive data here_  
_Note: This server is in development, please don't abuse it, it can be abused somewhat easily currently_
