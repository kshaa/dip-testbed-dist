# Verilog UART & physical LED usage
  
This example project contains a Verilog design to receive data over a serial UART interface and light up physical LEDs.  
  
## File structure
- `uart_rx.v` - Design to receive bytes from a serial interface  
- `uart_tx.v` - Design to send bytes over a serial interface  
- `main.v` - Design to receive a byte and light up corresponding phyiscal board LED lights
