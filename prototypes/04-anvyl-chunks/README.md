# Verilog UART usage
  
This example project contains a Verilog design to receive and send data over a serial UART interface.  
  
## File structure
- `uart_rx.v` - Design to receive bytes from a serial interface
- `uart_tx.v` - Design to send bytes over a serial interface
- `main.v` - Design to receive a byte and send back the byte `+ 1` over a serial interface
